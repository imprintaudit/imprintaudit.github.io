Imprint is a browser fingerprinting tool that runs entirely client-side. It demonstrates which browser features can reveal identifying information about a user.

It collects information such as fonts, canvas rendering, WebGL, audio processing, and accessibility preferences. The results are hashed locally to generate a uniqueness score.
